# Part 2, Final Project

## Wireframe in Shorthand

You can access the storyboard [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/o9sHPM63pOEIC9Er)

### Overview

I decided to make the wireframe outline in Shorthand, so that I could see how the project was going to look like at the end, as well as to familiarize myself with the tool. As I was creating and organizing my visualizations, I realized that the charts made in Flourish looked better than the ones made in Tableau, that is to say, their appearance did not change and they harmonized better with the storyboard design. For this reason, I decided to present all my charts from Flourish in this part and in part 3.

## User Research Protocol

### Target audience
The target audience of this storyboard is the legislative authorities of the Dominican Republic. I seek to create awareness of the huge problem that is affecting the country, starting by establishing the ranking in which we are positioned within the region, and how the region has the highest incidence in the world. The objective is to call for action towards measures that criminalize femicide as a crime per se, and not as an aggravated homicide, as it is currently contemplated in the penal code. Similarly, considering that the Attorney General's Office only recognizes in its statistics the femicides committed by intimate partners, the storyboard tries to make it clear that there are other types of femicides that should also be paid attention to. But not only that, it also means that the real statistics are even more alarming than what is being presented. Also, the consequences go even beyond the victims, affecting families and communities. Therefore, it is important that the authorities take action both with awareness and with penalties provided under the criminal code.
