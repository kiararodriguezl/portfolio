# Part 2, Final Project

## Wireframe in Shorthand

You can access the storyboard [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/o9sHPM63pOEIC9Er).

### Overview

I decided to make the wireframe outline in Shorthand, so that I could see how the project was going to look like at the end, as well as to familiarize myself with the tool. As I was creating and organizing my visualizations, I realized that the charts made in Flourish looked better than the ones made in Tableau, that is to say, their appearance did not change and they harmonized better with the storyboard design. For this reason, I decided to present all my charts from Flourish in this part and in part 3.

## User Research Protocol

### Target audience
The target audience of this storyboard is the legislative authorities of the Dominican Republic. I seek to create awareness of the huge problem that is affecting the country, starting by establishing the ranking in which we are positioned within the region, and how the region has the highest incidence in the world. The objective is to call for action towards measures that criminalize femicide as a crime per se, and not as an aggravated homicide, as it is currently contemplated in the penal code. Similarly, considering that the Attorney General's Office only recognizes in its statistics the femicides committed by intimate partners, the storyboard tries to make it clear that there are other types of femicides that should also be paid attention to. But not only that, it also means that the real statistics are even more alarming than what is being presented. Also, the consequences go even beyond the victims, affecting families and communities. Therefore, it is important that the authorities take action both with awareness and with penalties provided under the criminal code.

### Approach to choosing interviewees
In choosing the interviewees, I tried to have them come from different backgrounds, so that their perceptions of the storyboard would vary and I could get more diverse feedback. Although it was difficult for some people to be available to evaluate the wireframe and storyboard, I was able to interview three people that I considered would have varying perceptions: the background of one is in advertising, the second one is in audiovisual communication and the third one is in public policy. 

### Interview script
After showing them my storyboard in Shorthand, the questions asked were the following:
1. Tell me what you see. What do you understand from the wireframe and storyboard?
2. How does it make you feel? 
3. Is there something you find particularly useful or interesting?
4. Is there something you find confusing? Would you wish it were explained in more detail? How so? 
5. What do you like or not? Why?
6. Is there anything you learned? If so, what is it?
7. Do you have any suggestions on what would make it better?

### Interview findings

| Question | Female, publicist, mid-20s | Female, communicator, early-20s | Female, public policy student, late-20s |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Tell me what you see. What do you understand from the wireframe and storyboard? | Alarming news. Presenting a very concerning and sensitive topic, even more so because it involves my country, but a situation that needs to be addressed with the importance and urgency it demands. Everything is well presented, it calls the attention to an alarming issue, not only to authorities but people in general.| I see a website dedicated to explaining what femicide is and portraying the countries with the highest rate, while focusing on the DR being on the top 3 of Latin America. It also includes the average amount of women killed every day in the region and other important facts. | Femicide is a huge problem in Latin America and particularly in the DR, and that message is very clear. I really liked that it goes from macro to the micro. |
| How does it make you feel? | Extremely saddened. Because of the same root these homicides are based on, women being murdered because of their gender. | Saddened. Being from the DR myself, I’m used to this reality, but it never stops being heartbreaking seeing the violence all around. | It makes me feel shocked and sad, some of the images are very impactful, and some of the information shared is very worrisome. |
| Is there something you find particularly useful or interesting? | Yes, interesting that this happens more in Latin America. Why is that? Is there a cultural reason? | The fact that Brazil and Mexico aren't on the top of the list of femicide rates. It is known that the violence in those countries is significant, so seeing that the DR has a higher rate of femicide than those countries is surprising. | I found the graph on the number of femicides very helpful! I think it paints a clear picture on the magnitude of the issue. |
| Is there something you find confusing? Would you wish it were explained in more detail? How so? | Yes. On the first chart, where the countries with more femicides are presented, after Brazil and Mexico (that as well said aren't 1st and 2nd on the list based on the population), Dominican Republic is supposed to be 2nd on the list, but it doesn't seem that way on that chart. Looks like Argentina is second and when you click on it, you can see the numbers are higher than DR. | Nothing confusing but I would’ve liked to see a chart with information on that 9% increase of femicides in the past few years that is mentioned. | The graph where the DR is second is confusing… all of the lines in gray don’t add value. Maybe it would be more useful to add a line on the Latin American average and leave top 3. | 
| What do you like or not? Why? | I do like the visuals that were chosen and the dark colors, because it relates to a dark, sad topic. The information that’s presented is also clear, understandable, easy to read and comprehend and not overwhelming. Also, highlighted words helps to remember key words and the most important info. | I like that information is concise, easy to understand, and clear on what the message is. The way the website works when scrolling down makes it interesting and more engaging for the person reading the information, as well as the color palette also works with the vibe the subject transmits. | Some of the images can be a little graphic. I understand the point is to make it strong and impactful but some of them can also be a little disturbing. Like the one with the blood. |
| Is there anything you learned? If so, what is it? | Yes, the word femicide, or lets say its meaning. Never thought such a large percentage of women were murdered by their gender, and even more, in my country (the DR) and Latin America in general. | I learned that in the DR, the Attorney's General Office considers a femicide as such if it’s done at the hand of an intimate partner. In my opinion, it does not make sense for it to be seen like that and needs to be handled better, anyone can commit a femicide and needs to be punished to the extent of the law for it, intimate partner or not. Something similar is stated at the end when it says: “The DR needs to introduce femicides in the criminal code and penalized it as a crime different from homicide." | I really liked learning more about the topic, specifically on DR. The statistic that 50% of all femicides in the DR are in the hands of partners is really concerning. Adding information on children being left orphaned I think would add a lot to your story. |
| Do you have any suggestions on what would make it better? | Has DR or any of these countries taken any steps whatsoever to deal with this issue specifically? Not only homicides in general as was said. | Not much, maybe adding a note to each chart suggesting to hover the mouse over it to see more information, in case someone doesn’t realize. | Mentioned this already in different sections. But in addition, I think you can incorporate the story of a woman or about important movements in the region that have brought awareness to feminicide. |

### Key takeaways from interviews

- There is consensus among the interviewees that the storyboard makes them feel sad and shocked with the degree of severity that the country shows in terms of femicides.
- The most interesting visualization was the one about the number of femicides in the different countries from the region, where it can be seen the magnitude of the incidence.
- The dark color palette is in accordance with the subject and with the message to be conveyed, that is to say, it is in accordance with the seriousness of the subject.
- It seems to be unclear how feminicide is considered at the legal level in the Dominican Republic and what it means that the Attorney General's Office only accounts for feminicide at the hands of intimate partners.
- The difference between the chart of the number of femicides and the rate of femicides in Latin America does not seem to be clearly understood, especially when it says that it is adjusted for the size of the population.

### Group critique in class
- Reduce the number of colors in the graph that's showing the number of femicides in Latin America, by putting all the countries in gray with the exception of Brazil and Mexico in red.
- Lighten the gray in the line chart, to draw less attention to those countries. 
- Shorten the title of the area chart showing the proportion of deaths caused by the intimate partners in the DR.
- Edit the section explaining the population adjustment for the femicide rate to make the message easier to understand.
- Change the colors of the tree map graph of weapons used to 4 shades of red.
- Give a better explanation of the legal status of femicides in the DR to lead to the call to action.

### Planned changes based on feedback
- Reduce the number of colors in the treemap to gray to maintain the color tones of the wireframe and highlight Brazil and Mexico from the rest of the countries with red.
- Expand more on the legal status of femicide in the Dominican Republic so that the call to action makes sense.
- Be more explicit with the difference between the number of femicides and the femicide rate.
- Modify the line chart by adding a filter where countries can be compared, as well as lightening the gray of the lines to make them stand out less.
- Revise the titles and make sure that the storyboard is compelling.
