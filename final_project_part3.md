# Part 3, Final Project

You can access my storyboard here.

## Summary
Some aspects of the project changed slightly throughout the different parts and deliveries, which made me realize how complex it is sometimes to share a story that connects with the audience. Every aspect included in the story must be carefully chosen and told in a captivating way. For this reason, from the beginning I wanted to show the very serious situation in Latin America of the high number of women who die because of their gender and at the hands of their partners. This was something that was maintained throughout the different parts, and I tried to create that emotional hook at the beginning of the story through specific facts that could grab the attention of the audience. Through the different feedbacks, this was something that stood out not only with my interviewees but also with my classmates, as most of them had no idea of the seriousness of the problem and were shocked by the data. Likewise, from the beginning I kept the idea of starting with the macro perspective of the situation, and then going to a more micro perspective talking about the case of the Dominican Republic, which is one of the countries that stands out in the region.

Among the aspects that have been transforming throughout the different parts has been the visualization of the data. The main charts of the feminicides of the countries were taking a better shape through the feedbacks obtained, which made me realize that they could be confusing for an audience that was not familiar with the data, as I was. Thus, in the chart of the number of femicides by country I realized through the feedback from my classmates that due to the large number of countries, having different colors could distract attention from what the story wanted to highlight, that Brazil and Mexico had the highest number of femicides. For this reason, I decided to add color to only those two countries, leaving the rest in gray. Similarly, in the chart of femicide rates for the region, I only wanted to highlight the 3 countries with the highest rate, especially the Dominican Republic, so in addition to putting the other countries in gray, I decided to remove the labels, to avoid crowding the chart and highlight the names of the 3 countries with their relevant colors in the title and subtitle of the chart. Finally, I decided to elaborate more on the legal context regarding femicides in the Dominican Republic, since my classmates could not fully understand the relationship between the call to action and the information I had provided.

## Audience
My initial audience was the authorities of the Dominican Republic, legislators, policymakers, and the rest of the government, calling on them to take action on the issue. However, as I got feedback, I realized that this is an issue that the Dominican society is not as informed as one would expect, so I decided to reach out to them and the rest of the class, since the latter were not aware of (1) what feminicide was and (2) the serious situation in the region. Thus, I chose to explain the difference between a femicide and a female homicide, as well as to explain the difference between the countries with more femicides and those with higher femicide rates. In this way, I tried to use simple language so that the audience could easily understand.
