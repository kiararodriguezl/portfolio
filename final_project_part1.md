# Part 1, Final Project

## Summary
Latin America is the region with the highest number of femicides in the world, namely, with the highest number of gender-related deaths of women. Among the different types of femicides, one of the most common are the deaths of women at the hands of their intimate partners, whether current or former. By 2020, the Dominican Republic ranked as the second country in Latin America with more femicides per 100,000 women, with more than 50% of these being caused by intimate partners or ex-partners ([Gender Equality Observatory for Latin American and the Caribbean (ECLAC)](https://oig.cepal.org/en/indicators/femicide-or-feminicide)). The alarming figures have led to discussions about the reason why these homicides continue to occur despite the efforts that have been made, without showing a decrease over time. This has shown that policies aimed at reducing gender violence are not attacking the root causes of the problem, so the mechanisms created are not being effective. For this reason, it is important to call for the evaluation and design of policies that seek to protect women and adolescents from this tragedy.

## Outline
### Set up
The concept of femicide is unfamiliar to many people around the world, as the deaths of women are often included in the homicide rates of each country and not studied separately. I want to establish the importance of knowing femicides as deaths occurring on the basis of gender, due to the significance and impact it has on people's lives. In this way, I want to convey through statistics and data the alarming nature of the situation, so that the reader can understand the reality experienced by many people and countries, as well as the repercussions that this has on their lives.

### Conflict
The high rate of femicides in some countries, as opposed to others, raises the question of what are the factors that make it stand out more in some countries.  After looking at the incidence in Latin America, I will seek to present what are the dominant types of femicides in the Dominican Republic, as well as what factors could be influencing or lying behind the femicide rate. For this, some of the visualizations I will be including will be:
- Chart showing the femicide rates of Latin American countries in the last year.
- Chart showing the femicide rate trend in the Dominican Republic 
- Chart of different types of femicides or circumstances where femicides have occurred.
- Chart showing various factors affecting this problem.

### Resolution
After having explained the problem and visualized its impact, I will end with a call for intervention policies that seek to attack the root of the problem, beyond reactive policies such as a harsher prosecution of murderers. In the same way, I will also point out the great barrier that gender violence represents to achieve gender equality.

## Sketches

### Sketch 1
The purpose of this sketch is to draw the reader's attention to the issue of femicide, emphasizing the proportion of femicides that represent the deaths of women at the hands of their partners and ex-partners. This leads to reflect on the main motive behind them. The title of the visualization tells the story what the drawing seeks to convey, so that there is a quick association between the text and the image on the part of the reader. When coloring the dolls, I try to present the proportion and/or composition in a graphic way. Also, it made sense for me to choose red to draw them because of the blood that was spilled, and I only chose this color to keep the visualization as simple as possible.

### Sketch 2
With this sketch I want to draw attention to the position of the Dominican Republic in comparison to the rest of the Latin American region, highligting that by 2020 it was among the top 3 countries with the highest rate of femicides. Since there were so many countries, I only decided to give different colors to the top 3 and leave the rest in gray. In addition, in the title I highlighted that the Dominican Republic was in second place and I did it in red, the same color as the line in the chart that represents it. This chart seeks to present the seriousness of the situation and how the trend has continued over the years.

### Sketch 3
The purpose of this sketch is to show the main motive of femicides and how the absolute trend has been maintained over time. This chart shows how femicides at the hands of intimate partners have come to account for almost all of the deaths, averaging more than 50%. The graph presents a striking contrast between the two rates and the title seeks to highlight this comparison or composition between the two.

### Sketch 4
This sketch represents the different ways in which women have been murdered, highlighting how the majority have been of almost equal magnitude between a bladed weapon and a firearm. This chart seeks to reflect on the level of violence in the country and how it is demonstrated in these methods. This has the potential to guide possible policy interventions on the problem of how partners access firearms, as well as violence to beat women.

## Data
I will be taking some of my main data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) statistics, especially from the Gender Equality Observatory. You can access this website [here](https://oig.cepal.org/en/indicators) and go to the Physical Autonomy section where you will find several categories including "femicide or feminicide". In this way you can access the data pertaining to the indicator, and even compare different indicators by going directly to the statistics hub clicking [here](https://statistics.cepal.org/portal/cepalstat/dashboard.html?lang=en). This data provides information on the femicide rate of Latin American and Caribbean countries since 2001, however, not all countries have complete data. Thus, I will only focus on the last decade to compare trends. 
Likewise, I will be using data from the Dominican [Attorney General's Office](https://transparencia.pgr.gob.do/Inicio/i/5699_Estadisticas_de_Feminicidios_y_Homicidios_de_Mujeres) to focus on femicides in the Dominican Republic and to see the distribution of femicides in recent years. I will be complementing this data with information taken from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/markets/) to present data about the country. 

## Method and Medium
I will be using mostly Tableau and Flourish to create the charts for my project. By using the databases, I will choose the most important information and try to simplify them so that the visualizations will be easy for the reader to grasp and associate with the story that I will be describing or narrating. To present the final project, combining the different visualizations with the text, I will be using Shorthand. With this tool, I will be able to show the story in a seamless way, with transitions between the different information and data presented that will allow the reader to connect with the topic.
