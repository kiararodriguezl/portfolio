# Part 1, Final Project

## Summary
Latin America is the region with the highest number of femicides in the world, namely, with the highest number of gender-related deaths of women. Among the different types of femicides, one of the most common are the deaths of women at the hands of their intimate partners, whether current or former. By 2020, the Dominican Republic ranked as the second country in Latin America with more femicides per 100,000 women, with more than 50% of these being caused by intimate partners or ex-partners ([Gender Equality Observatory for Latin American and the Caribbean (ECLAC)](https://oig.cepal.org/en/indicators/femicide-or-feminicide)). The alarming figures have led to discussions about the reason why these homicides continue to occur despite the efforts that have been made, without showing a decrease over time. This has shown that policies aimed at reducing gender violence are not attacking the root causes of the problem, so the mechanisms created are not being effective. For this reason, it is important to call for the evaluation and design of policies that seek to protect women and adolescents from this tragedy.

## Outline
### Set up
The concept of femicide is unfamiliar to many people around the world, as the deaths of women are often included in the homicide rates of each country and not studied separately. I want to establish the importance of knowing femicides as deaths occurring on the basis of gender, due to the significance and impact it has on people's lives. In this way, I want to convey through statistics and data the alarming nature of the situation, so that the reader can understand the reality experienced by many people and countries, as well as the repercussions that this has on their lives.

### Conflict
The high rate of femicides in some countries, as opposed to others, raises the question of what are the factors that make it stand out more in some countries.  After looking at the incidence in Latin America, I will seek to present what are the dominant types of femicides in the Dominican Republic, as well as what factors could be influencing or lying behind the femicide rate. For this, some of the visualizations I will be including will be:
- Chart showing the femicide rates of Latin American countries in the last year.
- Chart showing the femicide rate trend in the Dominican Republic 
- Chart of different types of femicides or circumstances where femicides have occurred.
- Chart showing various factors affecting this problem.

### Resolution
After having explained the problem and visualized its impact, I will end with a call for intervention policies that seek to attack the root of the problem, beyond reactive policies such as a harsher prosecution of murderers. In the same way, I will also point out the great barrier that gender violence represents to achieve gender equality.

## Sketches

## Data
I will be taking some of my main data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) statistics, especially from the Gender Equality Observatory. You can access this website [here](https://oig.cepal.org/en/indicators) and go to the Physical Autonomy section where you will find several categories including "femicide or feminicide". In this way you can access the data pertaining to the indicator, and even compare different indicators by going directly to the statistics hub clicking [here](https://statistics.cepal.org/portal/cepalstat/dashboard.html?lang=en). This data provides information on the femicide rate of Latin American and Caribbean countries since 2001, however, not all countries have complete data. Thus, I will only focus on the last decade to compare trends. 
Likewise, I will be using data from the Dominican [Attorney General's Office](https://transparencia.pgr.gob.do/Inicio/i/5699_Estadisticas_de_Feminicidios_y_Homicidios_de_Mujeres) to focus on femicides in the Dominican Republic and to see the distribution of femicides in recent years. I will be complementing this data with information taken from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/markets/) to present data about the country.
