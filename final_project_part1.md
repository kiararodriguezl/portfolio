# Part 1, Final Project

## Summary
Latin America is the region with the highest number of femicides in the world, namely, with the highest number of gender-related deaths of women. Among the different types of femicides, one of the most common are the deaths of women at the hands of their intimate partners, whether current or former. By 2020, the Dominican Republic ranked as the second country in Latin America with more femicides per 100,000 women, with more than 50% of these being caused by intimate partners or ex-partners ([Gender Equality Observatory for Latin American and the Caribbean (ECLAC)](https://oig.cepal.org/en/indicators/femicide-or-feminicide)). The alarming figures have led to discussions about the reason why these homicides continue to occur despite the efforts that have been made, without showing a decrease over time. This has shown that policies aimed at reducing gender violence are not attacking the root causes of the problem, so the mechanisms created are not being effective. For this reason, it is important to call for the evaluation and design of policies that seek to protect women and adolescents from this tragedy.

## Outline
### Set up
The concept of femicide is unfamiliar to many people around the world, as the deaths of women are often included in the homicide rates of each country and not studied separately. I want to establish the importance of knowing femicides as deaths occurring on the basis of gender, due to the significance and impact it has on people's lives. In this way, I want to convey through statistics and data the alarming nature of the situation, so that the reader can understand the reality experienced by many people and countries, as well as the repercussions that this has on their lives.
