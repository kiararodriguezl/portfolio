# Share of Independent Workers by Demographic Group

## Step 1: Find a visualization

One of the areas where I would like to work and contribute as a professional is economic development. In turn, among the pillars that greatly drive the economic development of nations is their labor market. For this reason, knowing what percentage of the population is an independent worker will better guide the authorities when designing policies that seek to improve the labor condition of workers. While researching information on this topic, I came across a McKinsey Global Institute report on Independent Work. One of their graphs, the Independent workers span all demographic groups, tries to present the total number of independent workers in 6 different countries (United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, France and Spain) and the participation in independent work according to 4 demographic groups (youth, seniors, women, low-income households). However, the design of this graphic is not optimal for the audience to be able to internalize the information. For this reason, in the next step I will take the time to formally criticize how it could have been better designed, as well as what was well designed.

You can access the McKinsey report by accessing this [link](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/employment%20and%20growth/independent%20work%20choice%20necessity%20and%20the%20gig%20economy/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy-executive-summary.ashx) and view the visualization by going to page 12 of the pdf.

## Step 2: Critique the data visualization

To critique the visualization mentioned in the previous step, I used Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. After ranking the graph in several categories, I share my overall observations below, using some of the questions that Stephen includes in its evaluation.

### What stood out?
What is most striking to me was that the chart contained too much information and it was presented in different graphs within the same chart. For this reason, the audience can not grasp the message quickly, rather the eyes go from top to bottom and from left to right trying to understand how the chart is divided and what information belongs to what. Although the top area of the chart presents a "legend" on how to read the pie charts by demographic group, this example (1) is not the first thing the reader sees before starting to interpret the different pie charts, (2) the labels are not explicitly clear on what the difference is between the two numbers in each pie chart, and (3) the organization of the different charts and alignment of the texts confuse the reader, especially the two sets of numbers in the pie charts.

### What worked really well?
I consider that the colors used in the graph, especially in the demographic groups, are well used, since they are not too flashy and manage to identify each category with a color. Moreover, only the percentage of each category is highlighted with the colors, while the remaining percentage of each category was put in gray so as not to distract attention from the information that is important (the share of independent workers in each category) and does not conflict with the variety of colors being used in the chart.

### What would you do differently?
First, I would divide the information into at least two graphs, one to present the total number of independent workers by country, and another to present the participation of independent workers by demographic group and country. This way, the audience could focus on only one type of information at a time. Second, I would remove the boldness from the names of the demographic groups and leave only the main title in bold, because it gives the feeling that the graph is crowded. Third, I would not use pie charts to represent this data, but rather bars or lines, which allow to make a comparison of percentages and values in millions more easily. The way the pie charts present the percentages does not allow the reader to be intuitive, but rather to see the data in isolation, avoiding understanding the ultimate message of how the self-employed are divided between these powers and, therefore, the capture or absorption of the information.

### Who is the primary audience? Is the visualization effective for reaching that audience?
The primary audience is the leaders in the social, public and business sectors that McKinsey is trying to reach by providing them with facts and insights to inform their policy decisions. I believe the visualization can be effective for the audience because they may already be familiar with this information and the format McKinsey usually gives to its charts, however, the order and amount of information this visualization has could limit that effectiveness, making them take more time to interpret the information it is intended to deliver.

## Step 4: Test the solution

After drawing the 3 different types of visualizations to represent the information in the first chart, I proceeded to seek feedback from two people who could interpret and critique them from their perspective. For this, I elaborated some questions and used other questions recommended in the assignment to put together a survey that sought to capture the opinion and understanding of the interviewees. The additional questions I developed sought to get the interviewees to talk a little more about their initial impression of the sketches, as well as the level of elicitation and time it took them to understand the information.

The recommended questions were as follows:
1.	Can you tell me what you think this is? Can you tell me what you these sketches are trying to convey?
2.	Can you describe to me what these charts are telling you?
3.	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
4.	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
5.	Is there anything you would change or do differently?

The questions I added were:
1.	What was the first thing you noticed or was your first impression about the visualization?
2.	How much time did it take you to understand the graph? Did you understand it quickly, in a reasonable amount of time or did it take you a long time to grasp the information?
3.	Did it encourage you to know more about the topic?
4.	What did you think of the aesthetics?
5.	Which chart would you prefer?
6.	Rank the charts by preference and/or clarity of the information.

After having defined the questions, I proceeded to divide them into two groups. "General Questions" are the questions that would be answered in aggregate, taking into account all the sketches, while the others would be questions that would be answered for each visualization, in other words, independently. 

General Questions
1.	Can you tell me what you these sketches are trying to convey?
2.	Can you describe to me what these charts are telling you?
3.	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
4.	Did it encourage you to know more about the to?
5.	Which chart would you prefer?
6.	Rank the charts by preference and/or clarity of the information.

Questions for each visualization
1.	What was the first thing you noticed or was your first impression about the visualization?
2.	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing
3.	Is there anything you would change or do differently?
4.	How much time did it take you to understand the graph? Did you understand it quickly, in a reasonable amount of time or did it take you a long time to grasp the information?
5.	What did you think of the aesthetics?

Having said that, here are the responses of our two interviewees.

### Student, 29 years, background in policy

#### General Questions
##### 1.	Can you tell me what you these sketches are trying to convey?

While it provides information on independent workers by demographics, it is unclear to me what independent workers and independent workforce mean. It is unclear also what the distinction between the two terms is.

##### 2.	Can you describe to me what these charts are telling you?

It is trying to compare the % of independent workers by the demographic group across multiple countries.

###### 3.	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

The intended audience seems to be individuals in different countries that work in labor departments, labor economists, unions.

###### 4.	Did it encourage you to know more about the topic?

Not really, without context on what each of these concepts mean is hard to understand what’s going on.

###### 5.	Which chart would you prefer?

I would say the second one is the easiest to understand.

##### 6.	Rank the charts by preference and/or clarity of the information.

Second, first, third.

#### Questions for each visualization
##### 1.	What was the first thing you noticed or was your first impression about the visualization?

1st. That it looks organized, and good use of colors, but did not understand what the % meant.

2nd. Women seems to be the only group that has higher % of independent workforce than % of independent workers.

3rd. That the % don’t seem to add to anything, even though they are presented as complements of each other on the same bar.

##### 2.	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

1st. That it is unclear what are the bars indicating vs the % number next to it. I can’t tell from the graph which one is the % of independent workers and the % independent workforce.

2nd. That the dot for the % of independent workers is in gray instead of in each color.

3rd. The way the data is presented is very confusing.

##### 3.	Is there anything you would change or do differently?

1st. Clarify which % is each and add bars for both metrics per country.

2nd. Putting the value to the dots as well and updating the legend with the colors of each dot.

3rd. I would add separate bars for each category.

##### 4.	How much time did it take you to understand the graph? Did you understand it quickly, in a reasonable amount of time or did it take you a long time to grasp the information?

1st. I don’t think I clearly understand it. It is unclear what each % corresponds to.

2nd. Not much, this graph seems to be easier to understand than the previous one.

3rd. Given in this case you only consider one variable, I was able to understand it but the way the data is presented is not the best.

##### 5.	What did you think of the aesthetics?

1st. The graph looks pretty.

2nd. Better contrast between the bars that the previous graph.

3rd. The graph looks appealing to the audience.

### Adult, 23 years, background in communication

#### General Questions

##### 1.	Can you tell me what you think this is?

Representation of demographics of independent workers across European countries.

##### 2.	Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

They are trying to tell me that Sweden has the largest independent working populations across multiple demographics.

##### 3.	Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Labor policy researchers

##### 4.	Did it encourage you to know more about the topic?

Yes! I would love to know more about how independent work looks in these countries. What kind of work are they doing? What kind of policies affect this work?

##### 5.	Which chart would you prefer?

Probably number 3

##### 6.	Rank the charts by preference and/or clarity of the information

3, 1, 2

#### Questions for each visualization

##### 1.	What was the first thing you noticed or was your first impression about the visualization?

1st. The color pallet pleasing. It is somewhat hard to compare similar data across countries.

2nd. This is easier because there’s a grid. However, there’s a lot of colors going on.

3rd. Really like! The vertical connections between countries allows for easy comparison along categories.

##### 2.	Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

1st. I am not sure why the four categories are Youth, Senior, Women, and Low-Income. I also don’t really know what Independent Workers mean, and what the percentage is out of. The subtitle is somewhat confusing because there are two definitions for the percentage. The two numbers on each bar are also confusing to me.

2nd. I don’t understand the points with the bars. They confuse me a bit more I think.

3rd. I’m not exactly sure what these are adding up to. I feel like these categories probably overlap, so adding them together like they are, might be ignoring people who might be Young AND Low-Income – biasing the data and producing a bar length with less clear of a meaning.

##### 3.	Is there anything you would change or do differently?

1st. I might group by demographic group rather than country.

2nd. Maybe choose one type of data to portray, rather than try to put two different data points in each column.

3rd. I might not add them together to make bars, maybe just group them by category and label by country.

##### 4.	How much time did it take you to understand the graph? Did you understand it quickly, in a reasonable amount of time or did it take you a long time to grasp the information?

1st. It is taking me a while to be able to accurately compare trends across countries.

2nd. It was easy to understand everything but the small data points. Ignoring those, the bars were pretty easy to compare across countries and within countries.

3rd. Very quickly! But I think there were misconceptions introduced by the adding.

##### 5.	What did you think of the aesthetics?

1st. Loved it!

2nd. Very colorful. Maybe a little too colorful.

3rd. Love! Calming. Clear

### What did you learn from the feedback?

After evaluating the two interviews, the pattern that emerged was:
1.	The second sketch was the easiest chart to understand.
2.	The variety of colors are pleasing to the eye but distracting and make it difficult to assimilate the information.
3.	The legend and/or labels should be better explained or synthesized, that is, explicitly differentiate the difference between each variable that makes up the legend. In this case, it was not evident what was the difference between the two types of percentages of independent workers that the graph was analyzing, which made harder to understand the dots.

Considering these points of view, I learned that the simpler the chart, the better. This applies to the colors, type of graphic and amount of information in each of the visualizations. Likewise, I learned that titles, subtitles and labels should be as precise as possible, so that the information is transmitted instantly upon reading them and the association between the text and the graphic becomes immediate as well.

## Step 5: Build your solution

After receiving feedback on my sketches, I decided to choose the second one since according to the interviewees it was the one that conveyed the best information, as well as the one that they liked the most. Because of its design, the vertical bar chart allows a better comparison across and within countries, that is, comparing the different demographic groups between countries. In addition, I proceeded to modify the legend, changing the label of the dots from "% of independent workforce" to "% each group represents of the total independent workers". In this way, I am addressing the confusion that respondents expressed about not knowing the difference between the two types of information being presented in the chart between the bars and the dots. Similarly, I edited the title from "Independent workers by demographic groups" to "Share of Independent Workers by demographic groups" because that is the main information that the chart seeks to present through the bars, how much is the percentage or share of independent workers within these demographic groups in each country. Although the variety of colors was a bit concerning, I decided to leave these colors, so that it would be easier to compare each bar of each demographic group of a country with that of another country.

  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

## Step 6: Final solution

Ademas, consideré simplificar este sketch, removiendo los puntos que representaban el porciento que cada grupo significaba del total de trabajadores independientes de cada pais. Primero porque al no tener labels, la audiencia tenia que guiarse de los gridlines para saber el valor de cada uno, y segundo porque agregarles labels significaba hacer el chart muy crowded, complicando aun mas el analisis de la informacion.
