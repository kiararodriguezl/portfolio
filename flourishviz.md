# Government Debt of OECD Countries

This visualization seeks to show the total debt held by each OECD country as a percentage of its GDP. At the same time, the total debt at the OECD level is presented to compare which countries have the highest or lowest level of debt within the organization. It is important to clarify that this graph covers the latest available information of the countries, which may range from 2019 to 2021. The United States ranks fourth among the countries with the highest debt at 148% and above the total debt of OECD countries of 130%.

# Government Debt of G7 Countries

Unlike the previous graph where it is difficult to focus on a specific country or subset of countries, since all OECD countries are included, in this graph we can see what has been the trend of the government debt to GDP ratio of the G7 countries. In addition, we can compare each of these countries with the total ratio of all OECD countries. The government debt-to-GDP ratio of most of the G7 countries for 2021 is above the OECD total of 130.33%. Only Germany is below this total with a ratio of 77.44, while Canada is slightly over this total with 133.47%. Japan is the country with the highest debt to GDP ratio, at 259.57%, well above all other countries.
