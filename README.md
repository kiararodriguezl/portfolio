# About me
Hi! I'm Kiara from the Dominican Republic. I'm a second year MSPPM student at CMU. After graduating, I would like to work with policy analysis and more specifically with international and economic development.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn different ways to visualize data so that I can use it in policy analysis when I graduate next year.

# Portfolio
In this page you will see all the work that I do trying to better present or visualize a variety of data.
