# Share of Independent Workers by Demographic Group

## Step 1: Find a visualization

One of the areas where I would like to work and contribute as a professional is economic development. In turn, among the pillars that greatly drive the economic development of nations is their labor market. For this reason, knowing what percentage of the population is an independent worker will better guide the authorities when designing policies that seek to improve the labor condition of workers. While researching information on this topic, I came across a McKinsey Global Institute report on Independent Work. One of their graphs, the Independent workers span all demographic groups, tries to present the total number of independent workers in 6 different countries (United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, France and Spain) and the participation in independent work according to 4 demographic groups (youth, seniors, women, low-income households). However, the design of this graphic is not optimal for the audience to be able to internalize the information. For this reason, in the next step I will take the time to formally criticize how it could have been better designed, as well as what was well designed.

You can access the McKinsey report by accessing this [link](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/employment%20and%20growth/independent%20work%20choice%20necessity%20and%20the%20gig%20economy/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy-executive-summary.ashx) and view the visualization by going to page 12 of the pdf.

## Step 2: Critique the data visualization
