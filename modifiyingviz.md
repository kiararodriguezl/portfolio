# Share of Independent Workers by Demographic Group

## Step 1: Find a visualization

One of the areas where I would like to work and contribute as a professional is economic development. In turn, among the pillars that greatly drive the economic development of nations is their labor market. For this reason, knowing what percentage of the population is an independent worker will better guide the authorities when designing policies that seek to improve the labor condition of workers. While researching information on this topic, I came across a McKinsey Global Institute report on Independent Work. One of their graphs, the Independent workers span all demographic groups, tries to present the total number of independent workers in 6 different countries (United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, France and Spain) and the participation in independent work according to 4 demographic groups (youth, seniors, women, low-income households). However, the design of this graphic is not optimal for the audience to be able to internalize the information. For this reason, in the next step I will take the time to formally criticize how it could have been better designed, as well as what was well designed.

You can access the McKinsey report by accessing this [link](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/employment%20and%20growth/independent%20work%20choice%20necessity%20and%20the%20gig%20economy/independent-work-choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy-executive-summary.ashx) and view the visualization by going to page 12 of the pdf.

## Step 2: Critique the data visualization

To critique the visualization mentioned in the previous step, I used Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. After ranking the graph in several categories, I share my overall observations below, using some of the questions that Stephen includes in its evaluation.

### What stood out?
What is most striking to me was that the chart contained too much information and it was presented in different graphs within the same chart. For this reason, the audience can not grasp the message quickly, rather the eyes go from top to bottom and from left to right trying to understand how the chart is divided and what information belongs to what. Although the top area of the chart presents a "legend" on how to read the pie charts by demographic group, this example (1) is not the first thing the reader sees before starting to interpret the different pie charts, (2) the labels are not explicitly clear on what the difference is between the two numbers in each pie chart, and (3) the organization of the different charts and alignment of the texts confuse the reader, especially the two sets of numbers in the pie charts.

### What worked really well?
I consider that the colors used in the graph, especially in the demographic groups, are well used, since they are not too flashy and manage to identify each category with a color. Moreover, only the percentage of each category is highlighted with the colors, while the remaining percentage of each category was put in gray so as not to distract attention from the information that is important (the share of independent workers in each category) and does not conflict with the variety of colors being used in the chart.

### What would you do differently?
First, I would divide the information into at least two graphs, one to present the total number of independent workers by country, and another to present the participation of independent workers by demographic group and country. This way, the audience could focus on only one type of information at a time. Second, I would remove the boldness from the names of the demographic groups and leave only the main title in bold, because it gives the feeling that the graph is crowded. Third, I would not use pie charts to represent this data, but rather bars or lines, which allow to make a comparison of percentages and values in millions more easily. The way the pie charts present the percentages does not allow the reader to be intuitive, but rather to see the data in isolation, avoiding understanding the ultimate message of how the self-employed are divided between these powers and, therefore, the capture or absorption of the information.

### Who is the primary audience? Is the visualization effective for reaching that audience?
The primary audience is the leaders in the social, public and business sectors that McKinsey is trying to reach by providing them with facts and insights to inform their policy decisions. I believe the visualization can be effective for the audience because they may already be familiar with this information and the format McKinsey usually gives to its charts, however, the order and amount of information this visualization has could limit that effectiveness, making them take more time to interpret the information it is intended to deliver.
